# ADK Migration Guide

This document describes the migration from LangGraph to Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) for the animation generation application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated
- **Removed**: `langchain`, `langchain-core`, `langchain-google-vertexai`, `langgraph`
- **Added**: `google-adk>=0.1.0`
- **Kept**: Core dependencies like `fastapi`, `vertexai`, `requests`

### 2. New Architecture Files

#### `adk_agents.py`
Contains specialized ADK agents:
- **AnimationPlanner**: Analyzes user requests to determine if they want animations or conversation
- **ScriptGenerator**: Generates Blender Python scripts using ADK tools
- **RenderCoordinator**: Handles communication with the Blender rendering service
- **AnimationAgent**: Main sequential agent that orchestrates the workflow
- **ConversationAgent**: Handles general conversations and suggests animation ideas

#### `adk_tools.py`
ADK FunctionTool implementations:
- **analyze_animation_request**: Determines if user wants animation or conversation
- **generate_blender_script**: Creates Blender Python scripts with validation
- **render_animation_with_blender**: Sends scripts to animator service
- **validate_animation_script**: Validates scripts for safety and correctness

#### `adk_main.py`
New FastAPI application using ADK:
- Uses ADK SessionService for state management
- Maintains compatibility with existing endpoints (`/generate`, `/thread/{id}`)
- Implements streaming responses with ADK agents
- Provides better error handling and user feedback

### 3. Key Improvements

#### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has a specific role and expertise
- **Sequential Workflow**: Agents work together in a coordinated pipeline
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Planning, generation, and rendering are handled by different agents

#### Enhanced Tool System
- **ADK FunctionTools**: More robust tool integration with proper typing
- **Validation Pipeline**: Built-in script validation and safety checks
- **Error Recovery**: Better error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Improved User Experience
- **Context Awareness**: ADK's session management provides better conversation context
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time updates during animation generation
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multiple interactions

## Migration Benefits

### 1. **Simplified Architecture**
- Replaced complex LangGraph state management with ADK's native orchestration
- Cleaner separation between agents and tools
- More maintainable codebase

### 2. **Better Developer Experience**
- ADK's built-in developer UI for testing and debugging
- Native streaming support without custom SSE implementation
- Integrated session and state management

### 3. **Enhanced Capabilities**
- Multi-agent coordination for complex workflows
- Better conversation handling with specialized agents
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements

### 4. **Production Ready**
- Google-supported framework with enterprise features
- Better error handling and recovery
- Integrated monitoring and debugging tools

## Backward Compatibility

The migration maintains full backward compatibility:

- **Existing Frontend**: No changes required to the Next.js frontend
- **API Endpoints**: All existing endpoints (`/generate`, `/thread/{id}`) work unchanged
- **Response Format**: Same JSON response structures
- **Docker Deployment**: Same containerization approach

## Testing the Migration

1. **Build and run locally**:
   ```bash
   # In the agent directory
   docker build -t animation-agent-adk .
   docker run -p 8081:8080 animation-agent-adk
   ```

2. **Test endpoints**:
   ```bash
   # Test animation generation
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/generate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "spinning cube"}'
   
   # Test health check
   curl http://localhost:8081/health
   ```

3. **Use with existing frontend**:
   - The frontend should work unchanged
   - Test both animation generation and conversation features

## Future Enhancements

The ADK architecture enables several future improvements:

1. **Specialized Animation Agents**: Different agents for characters, objects, scenes
2. **Advanced Validation**: More sophisticated script analysis and optimization  
3. **User Preferences**: Personalized animation styles and preferences
4. **Batch Processing**: Multiple animation requests in parallel
5. **Advanced Streaming**: Real-time progress updates during rendering

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can easily rollback:

1. **Change Dockerfile**: Point back to `main.py` instead of `adk_main.py`
2. **Update requirements.txt**: Restore original LangGraph dependencies  
3. **Redeploy**: Use the original container image

The original files (`main.py`, `animation_graph.py`) are preserved for this purpose.
