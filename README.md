# GCP Demos, Notes and Tricks

A comprehensive repository of demos, code snippets, and implementation patterns for Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Originally developed for teaching cloud architecture and GCP services, these resources serve dual purposes: as **hands-on learning materials** for educational environments and as **production-ready blueprints** and **reference architectures** for real-world implementations.

## Table of Contents

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `bigquery` | Code snippets and demos for BigQuery data warehousing and analytics |
| `compute` | Code snippets and demos for Compute Engine virtual machines |
| `gke` | Code snippets and demos for Google Kubernetes Engine container orchestration |
| `modules` | Reusable Terraform modules for GCP infrastructure components |
| `run` | Code snippets and demos for Cloud Run serverless containers |

## Use Cases

### üìö **Educational & Training**

- Classroom demonstrations and hands-on labs
- Workshop materials for GCP certification training
- Step-by-step tutorials with clear learning objectives
- Real-world scenarios adapted for educational contexts

### üèóÔ∏è **Production Blueprints**

- Reference architectures for common GCP patterns
- Production-ready Terraform modules and configurations
- Best practices implementations following Google Cloud's [Well-Architected Framework](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework)
- Scalable foundation templates for enterprise deployments

## Prerequisites

- **Google Cloud SDK** - Command-line tools for GCP
- **Terraform** (for infrastructure code) - Version 1.0+ recommended
- **Google Cloud Project** with billing enabled
- **IAM Permissions** - Appropriate roles for the services you want to deploy

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gallaglo/gcp-demos-notes-and-tricks.git
   cd gcp-demos-notes-and-tricks
   ```

2. **Configure your Google Cloud project:**

   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

3. **Explore and deploy:**
   Navigate to any demo directory and follow the specific README instructions. Each demo includes both educational context and production considerations.

## Repository Structure & Design Philosophy

Each demo in this repository is designed with both **learning** and **production readiness** in mind:

### üéØ **Educational Features**

- Clear, commented code with explanations
- Progressive complexity from basic to advanced concepts
- Cost-conscious configurations suitable for learning environments
- Cleanup scripts to minimize charges during experimentation

### üöÄ **Production-Ready Elements**

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform)
- Security best practices and principle of least privilege
- Monitoring, logging, and observability configurations
- Scalability and high-availability patterns
- Environment-specific variable management

## Best Practices Implemented

- **Security First:** All configurations follow GCP security best practices
- **Cost Optimization:** Resource sizing and lifecycle management
- **Maintainability:** Modular, reusable code with clear documentation
- **Compliance:** Configurations align with common regulatory requirements
- **Automation:** Full infrastructure lifecycle management through code
